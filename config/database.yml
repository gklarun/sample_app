# MySQL.  Versions 5.0+ are recommended.
#
# Install the MYSQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'mysql2'
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:
#   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html
# NOTE: when creating DB from scratch need to change the encoding to utf8
# Then after running rake db:create
# Change to utf8mb4
#
default: &default
 adapter: mysql2
 encoding: utf8mb4
 pool: 5
 username: root
 password: password
 host: localhost

development:
  <<: *default
  database: app_club_dev

# Staging model - same settings and config as production, except point
# it at a different DB (so doesn't have customer data) on the AWS server
# This way it will behave almost identically to production.

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: app_club_test

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:

Production:
<<: *default
  adapter: postgres
  database: app_club_test
  password: password
  username: gklarun
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
